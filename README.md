# Laravel Webserver Configurations

This repository contains some server configuration files to get Laravel 4 running 'out-of-the-box' on a number of web servers. They will be used as examples within my upcoming book 'Code Bright'.

Contributions are encouraged. Let's make a set of bulletproof configurations for the Laravel framework!

Currently supported:

- Apache
- Nginx
- Pagodabox Boxfile with PHP 5.4

Thanks!
